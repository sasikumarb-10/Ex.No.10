# Ex.No.10: Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Register no:212223060252

# Aim:
To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

# Algorithm:  
- Step 1: Define Content Type & Audience
Identify what you're creating (report, story, documentation, etc.) and specify your exact audience with their needs, skill level, and decision-making context.
- Step 2: Choose Appropriate Framework
Select the right structural framework - DECIDE for decisions, Hero's Journey for creative content, STAR for case studies, or modular approach for technical docs.
- Step 3: Decompose Your Request
Break down your prompt into specific components instead of generic requests. List exactly what sections, analysis types, and outcomes you want.
- Step 4: Add Context Constraints
Include semantic filters (what to include/exclude), success criteria, format requirements, and any specific methodologies or data sources to use.
- Step 5: Iterate with Validation
Test your prompt, evaluate the output quality against your criteria, then refine the prompt structure based on gaps or improvements needed.

## 1. Query Decomposition Technique

### Basic Prompt:
"Write an article about renewable energy."

### Decomposed Prompt:
"Create a comprehensive article about renewable energy by addressing these components:
- Define renewable energy and its importance
- Analyze three main types: solar, wind, and hydroelectric
- Compare costs vs. traditional energy
- Discuss implementation challenges
- Provide future outlook with specific timeline"

### Impact on Content Quality

| Aspect        | Basic Approach             | Decomposed Approach                   |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Structure     | Often rambling, unclear flow | Clear sections, logical progression    |
| Depth         | Surface-level coverage       | Detailed analysis of each component    |
| Completeness  | May miss key topics          | Comprehensive coverage                 |
| Coherence     | Scattered thoughts           | Unified narrative thread               |

## 2. Decision-Making Frameworks

### The DECIDE Framework Applied

**Standard Prompt:**  
"Help me choose between freelancing and a corporate job."

**DECIDE Framework Prompt:**  
"Use the DECIDE framework to analyze freelancing vs. corporate employment:
- Define the decision clearly
- Establish criteria (income stability, flexibility, growth, benefits)
- Consider alternatives and options
- Identify best alternatives based on criteria
- Develop and implement action plan
- Evaluate and monitor solution"

### Results Comparison
- Standard approach: Generic pros/cons lists
- DECIDE framework: Structured analysis with actionable outcomes

## 3. Semantic Filtering Techniques

### Context-Aware Content Generation

**Unfiltered Prompt:**  
"Write about artificial intelligence."

**Semantically Filtered Prompt:**  
"Write about artificial intelligence specifically for small business owners who are non-technical but want to understand practical applications. Filter out:
- Technical jargon and complex algorithms
- Academic research details
- Theoretical concepts

Focus on:
- Real-world business applications
- Cost-benefit considerations
- Implementation simplicity
- Practical examples from similar businesses"

### Content Adaptation Results

| Audience        | Content Focus           | Language Style      | Examples Used           |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| General Public   | Broad overview           | Simple, accessible   | Consumer applications    |
| Business Owners  | ROI and implementation   | Professional, practical | Industry case studies |
| Developers       | Technical depth          | Precise, detailed    | Code snippets, APIs      |
| Students         | Learning progression     | Educational, structured | Step-by-step tutorials |

## 4. Creative Content: Comic Book Creation

### Traditional vs. Structured Prompting

**Basic Prompt:**  
"Create a superhero comic book story."

  - Panel 1: Ordinary world (establish character)  
  - Panel 2: Call to adventure (inciting incident)  
- **Confrontation Phase:**  
  - Panel 3: Refusal/hesitation  
  - Panel 4: Mentor appears/guidance  
- **Resolution Phase:**  
  - Panel 5: First threshold crossed  
  - Panel 6: New world established

Character: Environmental scientist with plant-based powers  
Setting: Near-future urban environment  
Theme: Technology vs. nature balance  
Visual style: Realistic with vibrant nature elements"

### Creative Output Enhancement
- Coherent narrative arc
- Visual consistency
- Character development
- Thematic depth

## 5. Report Generation: Comparative Analysis

### Standard vs. Enhanced Prompting

**Standard Prompt:**  
"Create a market analysis report for electric vehicles."

- Executive Summary (2-sentence key findings)
- Methodology (SWOT + Porter's Five Forces)
- Market Segmentation Analysis (luxury, mass market, commercial)
- Competitive Landscape Matrix
- Financial Projections (5-year outlook)
- Risk Assessment
- Strategic Recommendations"

### Report Quality Metrics

| Element             | Standard Report        | Enhanced Prompting       |
